The reversible object-oriented programming language (\textsc{Roopl}) was presented late 2016 and proved that object-orientated programming was feasible in the reversible setting. The language featured simple statically scoped objects which made non-trivial programs tedious, if not impossible to write using the limited tools provided.
We introduce an extension to \textsc{Roopl} in form the new language \rooplpp, featuring dynamic memory management and static arrays for increased language expressiveness. The language is a superset of \textsc{Roopl} and has formally been defined in its language semantics, type system and computation universality. Considerations for reversible memory manager layouts were considered and ultimately led to the selection of the buddy memory layout. Translations of the extensions presented in \rooplpp to the reversible assembly language \textsc{Pisa} are presented to provide garbage-free computations. The extension proved to be feasible in extending the expressiveness of \textsc{Roopl} and as a result, showed that non-trivial reversible data structures, such as reversible binary trees and doubly-linked lists, are feasible and does not contradict the reversible computing paradigm.
